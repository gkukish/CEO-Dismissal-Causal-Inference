# Capstone

This is a working directory for my final year Capstone project at Minerva University.

## Abstract
This project examines the connection between Negative Financial Performance Metrics (FPMs) and Involuntary CEO Dismissal in contemporary corporate governance. Using Gentry et al.'s (2021) CEO departure data set, we address limitations such as the absence of FPMs data and challenges with non-standard company tickers and time-series data presentation.

The study emphasizes meticulous data refinement, creating a comprehensive data set with relevant variables. Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) guide our variable selection without assuming direct causality. A key proxy outcome variable measures changes in financial performance metrics before and after CEO dismissal, specifically focusing on net income as a binary variable indicating shifts above or below the mean.

The project aims to reveal the impact of net income on involuntary CEO dismissal decisions. Employing computational statistics and causal inference methodology, we explore the significant relationship between these variables, enhancing our understanding of the interplay between microeconomic shocks, the market, and leadership decisions in a data-driven manner.
